# Simple React Calculator

A simple calculator built using React. This calculator allows you to enter in a full list of operations before calculating. It leverages the Shunting Yard algorithm to resolve the order of operations.

I used [react-simple-boilerplate](https://github.com/nolotz/react-simple-boilerplate) for this project.

### Usage

Clone the repo on your machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/seanjyoung/react-calculator.git
```

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```
npm/yarn install
npm/yarn start
open http://localhost:3000
```
